This code implements the bully algorithm for selecting a leader.
To run it, run ProcessA, ProcessB and ProcessC concurrently.
The processes have identifiers 0, 5 and 10 respectively. They
also use ports 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. You will see 
the output in the console that identifies a coordinator as
well as the election process for that coordinator. 

After, ProcessC, the one with the largest identifier(10) has 
been chosen, kill it and see that ProcessB with identifier 5 
will be chosen as new coordinator. Booting ProcessC again
will see it being elected as the new leader.
